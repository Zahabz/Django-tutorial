#                        My First Django Tutorial

**Django** is a high level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean pragmatic design. It is:
1. Ridiculously fast
2. Reassuringly secure
3. Exceedingly stable
4. Incredibly versatile

In this tutorial, I wrote a web app called **Learning Log** that allows users to log the topics they are interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about the topic. The home page will describe the site and invite the users to either register or login. Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries and read and edit existing entries.

In order to carry out this tutorial, one has to install the packages clearly spelt out in the *requirements text* file and you are good to go.
